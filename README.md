### How to run

* Execute the command `mvn install`
* Run the `*-with-dependencies.jar` file that exists in `./target`
    - Example: `java -jar target/parser-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar --input-file-path example.input --output-file-path output.xml
`

There exists an executable jar in the repository as well under the folder `target`.
